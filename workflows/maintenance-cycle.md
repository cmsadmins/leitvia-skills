# Workflow: maintenance-cycle

A regular maintenance run on a site with the Leitvia theme and Leitvia Studio: repair what broke, check accessibility, report to the person. The workflow chains two skills and a report and stops at fixed checkpoints; each skill keeps its own rules and checkpoints. How to call the abilities, hashes and rejections: [agent handbook](../handbook/README.md).

Chain: [leitvia-maintain](../skills/leitvia-maintain/SKILL.md), then [leitvia-a11y](../skills/leitvia-a11y/SKILL.md), then the report.

## Choose the mode at the start

Ask the person once, before the first write, and keep the answer for the whole run.

- **package** (default): choose one key for the run, for example `maintenance-2026-10`, and send it as `package` on every write of both skills. Every write lands in that one change package, corrections included; nothing goes live before the person applies it.
- **direct:** send no key, the autonomy levels of the site decide. With the default levels (`corrections` autonomous, `content` draft) repaired links and alt text go live at once, each recorded as an applied package of its own that `leitvia/rollback` can undo, and changes of texts on published pages wait in a package for the person. Legal texts, prices, slugs and organization data stay a proposal all the same: send these writes with a key, so they wait in a package.

Every rejection is corrected at most once (follow `message`, `next_ability` and `retry`); a second rejection of the same call, or `retry: never`, is a checkpoint: stop and show the person the rejection.

## Steps

### 1. Maintenance

- **Skill:** leitvia-maintain, steps 1 to 6.
- **Input:** the request of the person; the site itself through `leitvia/audit-site` (keep the result, it is the "before" of the report).
- **Writes:** `leitvia/repair-links`, `leitvia/set-alt-text`, `leitvia/replace-pattern`, `leitvia/update-content`, with the key in mode `package`.
- **Checkpoints:** "Link targets": "The link <text> on <page> leads to <old address>, which does not exist. Which page should it lead to?" "Section without replacement": "The section <pattern> on <page> is deprecated and has no replacement. Keep it, remove it or rebuild it?" "Facts from the person": "<text> on <page> looks outdated. What is the current value?"

### 2. Accessibility

- **Skill:** leitvia-a11y, steps 1 to 4.
- **Input:** the pages of step 1 and their findings after the maintenance writes; the same audit, the public pages.
- **Writes:** alt text, decorative images, link texts, empty headings, heading levels, with the same key in mode `package`.
- **Checkpoints:** "Link targets" and "AI for alt text" of the skill: "May the images of <pages> go to the AI provider of the site for a first draft of their alt text?"

### 3. Package

- `leitvia/list-packages` with `state: open`: in mode `package` exactly one package with your key; in mode `direct` the packages of the writes the levels held back. `leitvia/get-package` with each `id` gives the diff per operation and the `preview` link.
- **Checkpoint "Package applied":** "Package <id> holds <n> changes: <short list>. Please review it in the inbox at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=leitvia-studio-inbox&package=<id>` (block diff and preview) and apply it. Shall I wait?"
- After it is applied: `GET /wp-cron.php` where WP-Cron does not run by itself, then `leitvia/audit-site` again; that is the "after" of the report. A `conflict` in the applied package means someone changed the post in between: read it again and repeat that change once in a new run.

### 4. Report

In the language of the person:

1. **Packages:** ID, state and inbox link of each package; in mode `direct` also the corrections that went live, with the ID of their recorded package.
2. **Before and after:** findings per page from the first and the last audit, counted per check.
3. **Fixed:** per page what changed (links from and to, alt texts, replaced sections, texts, heading levels).
4. **Open with reason:** findings no ability fixes, links in header, footer or navigation, external links not checked, conflicts.
5. **For a person:** the tests leitvia-a11y lists in its step 6 (keyboard, screen reader, zoom). Never call the site accessible or compliant.

## Checkpoints

1. **Link targets**, **Section without replacement** and **Facts from the person** (step 1).
2. **AI for alt text** (step 2).
3. **Package applied** (step 3), before the audit after.
4. **Rollback confirmed**, only when the person asks to undo a package (leitvia-maintain, Rollback).
5. **Second rejection** of the same call, or a rejection with `retry: never`, in any step.
