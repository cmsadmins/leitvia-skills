# Workflow: migrate-site

From a classic theme to the Leitvia theme: inventory, theme switch by a person, brand, content as blocks, accessibility check. The workflow chains three skills and stops at fixed checkpoints; each skill keeps its own rules and checkpoints. How to call the abilities, hashes and rejections: [agent handbook](../handbook/README.md).

Chain: [leitvia-migrate](../skills/leitvia-migrate/SKILL.md) (inventory), the theme switch by a person, [leitvia-design](../skills/leitvia-design/SKILL.md), leitvia-migrate again (content and menu), then [leitvia-a11y](../skills/leitvia-a11y/SKILL.md).

## Choose the mode at the start

Ask the person once, before the first write, and keep the answer for the whole migration.

- **package** (default): choose one key for the migration, for example `migrate-2026-10`, and send it as `package` on every write of every step. Every write lands in the change package of that key; nothing goes live, whatever the autonomy levels of the site allow. A step that needs what an earlier package creates (the activation of a new token set) comes after the checkpoint **Package applied**; the same key then starts the next package.
- **direct:** send no key, the autonomy levels of the site decide. Legal texts, prices, slugs and organization data stay a proposal all the same: send these writes with a key, so they wait in a package. With the default levels changes to published posts wait in a package anyway.

Every rejection is corrected at most once (follow `message`, `next_ability` and `retry`); a second rejection of the same call, or `retry: never`, is a checkpoint: stop and show the person the rejection.

## Steps

### 1. Inventory

- **Skill:** leitvia-migrate, step 1, while the classic theme is still active.
- **Input:** the address of the site; `leitvia/audit-site`, `leitvia/get-page-outline`, `leitvia/get-block` and the public pages.
- **Writes:** none.
- **Checkpoint "Inventory confirmed":** "These are the posts, menus, widgets and brand values I found, and these items I cannot move: <table>. Is the list complete?"

### 2. Theme switch, done by a person

Agents cannot switch themes or activate plugins; the area `admin` is locked. Ask the person to do it in one of two ways:

- WP-CLI on the server: `wp theme activate leitvia`, and `wp plugin activate leitvia-studio` when Studio is not active yet.
- Backend: Appearance, Themes, Leitvia, Activate.

**Checkpoint "Theme switch":** "Please activate the theme Leitvia (and Leitvia Studio, if it is not active). Tell me when it is done." Then call `leitvia/get-contract`: it answers with the contract of Leitvia, and `site.url` is the address of the site. When it still answers `leitvia_no_contract`, the switch did not happen; ask again and write nothing.

### 3. Brand

- **Skill:** leitvia-design, steps 1 to 5.
- **Input:** the brand values of the inventory (colors with their use, fonts, logo).
- **Writes:** `leitvia/create-token-set` with the key. Skip the step when the person wants to keep the brand for later.
- **Checkpoint:** "Contrast correction accepted", only when you changed a brand value: "Your link color <old> misses <pair> (<ratio>). <new> reaches <ratio>. May I use <new>?"

### 4. Content and menu

- **Skill:** leitvia-migrate, steps 4 to 6.
- **Input:** the posts of the inventory, read again after the switch (`document_hash` of `leitvia/get-block`).
- **Writes:** `leitvia/update-content` per post with the whole block markup, `leitvia/update-navigation` for the main menu, both with the key. Several writes to one post in the same package build on each other.
- **Checkpoint "Sample of three":** "I translated <three posts>. Please compare them with the old pages before I write the rest." Then "Open items": "These items have no block in the migration: <list>. What should happen with each?"

### 5. Package

- `leitvia/list-packages` with `state: open`: in mode `package` exactly one package with your key. `leitvia/get-package` with its `id` gives the diff per operation and the `preview` link.
- **Checkpoint "Package applied":** "Package <id> holds <n> changes: <short list>. Please review it in the inbox at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=leitvia-studio-inbox&package=<id>` (block diff and preview) and apply it. Shall I wait?"
- After it is applied, activate the token set (leitvia-design, step 6) with the same key; that is the next package and the same checkpoint.

### 6. Accessibility check

- **Skill:** leitvia-a11y.
- **Input:** every migrated page and post, after the packages of step 5 were applied.
- **Writes:** fixes with the same key, one more package when there is anything to fix.
- **Checkpoints:** "Link targets", "AI for alt text" and "Package applied" of the skill.

## Report

In the language of the person: the packages with ID, state and inbox link; per post its address before and after (they must match) and any heading level you changed; the brand values and their roles; open items with the reason; what only a person can test. Never call the site accessible or the migration complete while an open item remains.

## Checkpoints

1. **Inventory confirmed** (step 1).
2. **Theme switch**, done by the person (step 2).
3. **Contrast correction accepted** (step 3, only when a brand value changed).
4. **Sample of three** and **Open items** (step 4).
5. **Package applied** after steps 4, 5 and 6.
6. **Second rejection** of the same call, or a rejection with `retry: never`, in any step.
