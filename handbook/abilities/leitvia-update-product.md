# leitvia/update-product

Generated from Leitvia Studio 1.3.6. Do not edit. Group: Maintain. How to call abilities, hashes, autonomy and rejections: [agent handbook](../README.md).

**Update product.** Updates texts, status, images, categories and tags of one product or variation, and its prices, tax and shipping class. Read the product with leitvia/get-product first and send its hash as base_hash. Images need alt text (set it with leitvia/set-alt-text first). Changes to prices, taxes or shipping land at most as a suggestion unless a person unlocked them.

MCP tool `leitvia-update-product`, REST POST. Annotations: readonly false, destructive true, idempotent false. Only registered while woocommerce is active.

| `regular_price` | string, max length `20`, pattern `^([0-9]+([.][0-9]+)?)?$` |  | Price as a decimal number with a dot, empty for none. A price change lands at most as a suggestion. |
