# leitvia/apply-package

Generated from Leitvia Studio 1.3.3. Do not edit. Group: Maintain. How to call abilities, hashes, autonomy and rejections: [agent handbook](../README.md).

**Apply change package.** Applies the open operations of a change package, all or the listed ones. Find the package with leitvia/list-packages and check its diff with leitvia/get-package first. Each operation checks its base hash; one whose target changed stays open with a conflict, the others are written with snapshot and audit entry. Agents may only apply operations whose autonomy level is autonomous.

MCP tool `leitvia-apply-package`, REST POST. Annotations: readonly false, destructive false, idempotent false.
