It must compile against the contract and pass every token set check; contrast findings name the failing pair and the ratio it needs. Activate it with leitvia/activate-token-set.

| `document` | object | yes | DTCG token document, as leitvia/get-tokens returns it. |
| `base_hash` | string | yes | Hash of the target as last read; empty for a new object. |
| `package` | string, max length `64` |  | Key of the task: a write with a key always goes into the change package of that key, even where the autonomy would allow it live, and operations with the same key share that package. |
