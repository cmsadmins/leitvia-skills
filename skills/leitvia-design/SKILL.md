description: Derives a Leitvia token set from a brand (colors, fonts, radii, spacing, logo) and activates it through the leitvia abilities only. Maps brand values to the color roles of the design contract, computes every contrast pair before writing, fixes a contrast rejection itself once, and hands the set to a person as a change package; without a brand of its own it applies a style variation of the theme instead. Use it when a site should carry a brand or another look; site structure belongs to leitvia-setup, pages to leitvia-page.

# leitvia-design

Bring a brand onto a Leitvia site as a token set: one DTCG document with every role of the design contract, checked for contrast, activated by a person. You change the site only through the abilities of Leitvia Studio.

Read before the first call: the [agent handbook](../../handbook/README.md) (access, hashes, autonomy, packages, rejections, index of all abilities). Read the page of an ability before you first call it: [get-contract](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-get-contract.md), [get-tokens](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-get-tokens.md), [create-token-set](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-create-token-set.md), [activate-token-set](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-activate-token-set.md), [set-variation](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-set-variation.md), [audit-site](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-audit-site.md). Roles, token format, the contrast formula, fonts and what a token set cannot carry: [token details](references/tokens.md).

## Ground rules

- Write only through `leitvia/*` abilities. No CSS, no child theme, no SQL, no WP-CLI, no REST routes of WordPress core (`/wp-json/wp/v2/...`), not even to read.
- The site is the one at the address of your task, which in a multisite network can have a path (`https://example.org/club/`); every path starts there, not at the host. Call `leitvia/get-contract` first and compare `site.url` with that address; when they differ, write nothing and ask the person.
- Token sets and their activation are in the area `design`, which by default only suggests: every write lands in a change package for a person. Send one `package` key for the task, for example `brand-2026-10`.
- **Facts are never guessed.** Organization data, prices, legal texts, figures, quotes and people come only from a source you can name: the person, a page of the site or a read ability, with the source in your report. Without one, stop at a checkpoint; never write a placeholder that looks like a fact.
- Brand values are facts too: they come from the brand source the person names (style guide, design file, existing site). Never guess a brand color or font; a value you cannot find is a question to the person. The one exception: the person asks you to design the brand ("own brand, your proposal", an invented demo site). Then choose the values, compute every pair and call the set a proposal in its `$description` and in your report.
- Roles, slugs and the contrast pairs come from `leitvia/get-contract`, never from memory or from files of the theme.
- A rejection is corrected once. If the corrected call is rejected again, stop and ask the person.

## Workflow

### 1. Collect the brand

Ask for, or read from the source the person named: colors with their intended use, fonts (family, weights, license, whether the files are available), radii (fields, buttons), spacing grid, logo files for light and dark backgrounds. Write down brand rules that are not values, for example "the accent color is never a large surface" or "headings bold".

Checkpoint "Brand confirmed".

### 2. Read the site

- `leitvia/get-contract`: `roles` (every color, font size, font family, spacing, radius and shadow slug), `pairs` (foreground, background, minimum ratio, optional `ring`).
- `leitvia/get-tokens`: the current `document` (start from it), `sets` (existing token sets) and `contrast` (findings of the current palette).
- The front page: its `--wp--preset--color--*` and `--wp--preset--font-family--*` values are what visitors see. When they differ from the `document`, tell the person which values differ and ask which ones to keep before you write; never build a set on values the site does not show.
- A style variation of a recipe (such as `corporate-light`, in the same package as the recipe) and a token set do not add up: once the set is active, its colors and fonts replace those of the variation. Build the set on the `document` of `leitvia/get-tokens`; a variation that still waits in an open package is no reason to ask.

### 3. Map brand values to roles

Copy the `document` of `leitvia/get-tokens` and change only `$value` entries, keeping every slug. Roles and the value format: [token details](references/tokens.md#roles). A brand color that fits no role (for example a second orange for print) stays out of the set; mention it in the `$description` of the set.

### 4. Compute every contrast pair before writing

For every entry of `pairs`, compute the WCAG 2.2 ratio of `fg` on `bg`, rings included, with the formula in [token details](references/tokens.md#contrast). Check all pairs, not only the ones the brand guide mentions.

### 5. Create the token set

Call `leitvia/create-token-set` with `title`, `document`, empty `base_hash` and your `package` key.

When it is rejected with `leitvia_check_failed`, correct exactly once: change the brand side of the failing pair, keep the hue, and send the corrected document once ([token details](references/tokens.md#contrast)). Tell the person which value replaced which and the ratios it reaches. If the second call is rejected too, stop at checkpoint "Contrast correction accepted" with both finding lists.

Checkpoint "Contrast correction accepted" whenever you changed a brand value.

### 6. Activate

The new set exists only after the person applied the package of step 5 (checkpoint "Package applied"). Then:

1. `leitvia/get-tokens`: take the `id` of the new set from `sets` (status `inactive`).
2. `leitvia/activate-token-set` with `set`, empty `base_hash` and the same `package` key. When the site already has global styles the call is rejected with `leitvia_stale_hash`; repeat it once with `current_hash` from the rejection.
3. The activation lands in a new package. Checkpoint "Package applied" again.

### 7. Verify on the front end

After the person applied the activation:

- `leitvia/get-tokens`: `source` is `set`, `active` is the ID of your set, `drift` is false, `contrast` is empty.
- Fetch the front page and check that the CSS custom properties carry your values, for example `--wp--preset--color--accent` with your accent hex. On some sites global styles written without a signed in user were not found again and the site silently fell back to the theme default; only the front end proves the brand is live.
- `leitvia/audit-site`: no new findings.

### Style variation instead of a brand

When the person wants one of the looks of the theme and no brand of its own, take the slug from the style variations of `leitvia/get-contract` and call `leitvia/set-variation` with `variation`, empty `base_hash` and the `package` key; after `leitvia_stale_hash` repeat it once with `current_hash`. A full variation replaces the global styles, a colors or typography variation only its part. While a token set is active (`source` of `leitvia/get-tokens` is `set`), its colors and fonts win over any variation, so do not set one; tell the person. Then checkpoint "Package applied" and step 7.

Fonts the theme does not bundle, heading weights, layout widths, the logo and composition rules of the brand: [token details](references/tokens.md#fonts). Tell the person what the set cannot carry.

## Checkpoints

Stop and wait for the person at each of these points. Report the values, the computed ratios and the exact question.

1. **Brand confirmed:** colors with their use, fonts, radii, spacing and logo come from the source the person named.
2. **Contrast correction accepted:** you changed a brand value to meet a contrast pair; the person agrees to the new value (or the second attempt failed and you show both finding lists).
3. **Package applied:** the person applied the package with the token set, and later the package with the activation, in the inbox of Leitvia Studio.

Also stop after the second rejection of the same call.

## Unattended

When no person answers (a scheduled or hosted run), do not wait at a checkpoint. Send the `package` key on every write, even when the briefing says nobody visits the site (mode `direct` needs a person who is present); never apply, roll back or publish anything. Take facts only from a source you name in the report (briefing, a page of the site, a read ability); without one the fact stays out and becomes an open question. A second rejection, or `retry: never`, stops that part. End with the package ID, what it holds and the open questions. Each checkpoint gets this answer:

| Checkpoint | Answer without a person |
|---|---|
| Brand confirmed | Only values the briefing or the named brand source states; a role without a value keeps the value of the current `document`. The briefing asks you to design the brand: your proposal, as in the ground rules. No source and no such request: skip the skill and report it; the workflow goes on without a brand. |
| Contrast correction accepted | Make the one correction of step 5 and leave the set in the package; report old and new value with their ratios as a question. |
| Package applied | Stop after step 5; activation and the front end check belong to the next run. |

Steps only a person can do go into the report as a list: [new-site, steps of the person](../../workflows/new-site.md#steps-of-the-person).
