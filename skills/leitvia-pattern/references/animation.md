# Animation on scroll

Details for `leitvia-pattern` and `leitvia-page`. Read it before you give a block an effect, or when an audit or a person asks about motion.

Leitvia Studio gives every block two attributes, core blocks included. `leitviaAnimation` is the effect: `none` (the default) or one of the values below. `leitviaMotion` is its strength: `subtle` or `bold`; without it the site default of the Studio settings applies (subtle unless the site owner changed it). Only the block comment carries the values; the saved HTML stays as it is, and Studio adds the classes `has-lv-animation is-lv-animation-<effect> is-lv-motion-<strength>` on the front end. The block `leitvia/reveal` (attribute `effect`: fade, rise, stagger) uses the same style and script. The attributes are missing on blocks without markup of their own and on the navigation: `core/html`, `core/shortcode`, `core/freeform`, `core/block`, `core/pattern`, `core/template-part`, `core/post-content`, `core/navigation` and its links, `core/page-list`, `leitvia/reveal`, `leitvia/mega-menu` and a few more. `leitvia/list-blocks` lists them, with their descriptions, in the attributes of the blocks of its catalog.

| Effect | What it does (subtle / bold) | Fits |
|---|---|---|
| `fade` | fades in | text, quiet sections |
| `rise` | fades in while it moves up 2.5rem / 5rem | text sections, single cards |
| `zoom` | fades in from 0.92 / 0.84 of its size | images, a single card, a figure |
| `slide-start` | fades in from 2.5rem / 5rem before the start of the line (left, right in right-to-left languages) | media and text side by side, the media half |
| `slide-end` | the same from the end of the line | the other half |
| `wipe-up` | uncovers itself from the bottom up (the whole element, never split into words) | headings, images, covers |
| `wipe-start` | uncovers itself from the start of the line | headings, images, covers |
| `blur` | fades in out of an 8 px / 16 px blur | images, a quote |
| `mask` | an image uncovers itself from its centre, 15 % / 30 % of each side | images, galleries |
| `stagger` | each direct child as `rise`, each when it comes into view itself; children that come into view together start 100 ms apart up to the sixth. A child with an effect of its own keeps it | cards, columns, icon lists, grids |
| `parallax` | bound to the scroll position: the background of a cover moves by up to 4 % / 8 % of its height, the line of a timeline (`leitvia/timeline`) draws itself along | `core/cover`, `leitvia/timeline` only |

Every reveal runs once, in 800 ms (subtle) or 1200 ms (bold) on a soft curve (GSAP power3.out, bold expo.out). Parallax only runs in browsers with scroll-driven animations; elsewhere the cover and the line stand still. Effects use opacity, transform, clip-path and filter only, so nothing moves the layout.

What a visitor sees: the script hides only blocks that start below the visible area when the page loads; what is in view stays as it is, so nothing flickers and LCP and CLS do not change. A hidden block starts once a fifth of it is above a line 12 % over the bottom edge of the window; a block taller than the window starts once a third of the window height of it is in view. Keyboard focus inside a hidden block and a jump to an anchor (the target and everything above it) show it at once, without the effect. Without JavaScript, with reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`), with the switch "Motion off" of the accessibility bar, in print and in the editor every block is simply there. With the site setting "Motion off" Studio loads neither style nor script.

## Markup

The values go into the block comment, nothing else changes:

```html
<!-- wp:group {"metadata":{"name":"Services"},"leitviaAnimation":"rise","align":"full","style":{"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"var:preset|spacing|xl","bottom":"var:preset|spacing|xl"}}},"layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignfull" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xl);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xl)">...</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:columns {"leitviaAnimation":"stagger","align":"wide"} -->
<div class="wp-block-columns alignwide">...</div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":12,"sizeSlug":"large","leitviaAnimation":"mask","leitviaMotion":"bold"} -->

<!-- wp:leitvia/icon-list {"icon":"circle-check","leitviaAnimation":"stagger","fontSize":"lead"} -->
```

Key order as the editor saves it: `leitviaAnimation`, then `leitviaMotion`, come after the attributes of the block itself (`icon`, `id`, `sizeSlug`, `verticalAlignment`, `postType`), after `lock` and `metadata`, and before every attribute of the block supports: `align`, `className`, `style`, the colors, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `layout` and `anchor`. Leave out `"leitviaAnimation":"none"`, it is the default and the editor does not save it; leave out `leitviaMotion` for the site default. A value outside the lists is ignored on the front end. As everywhere, copy the order from markup the editor saved and never sort keys.

## When to use it

- **Sparingly.** On a home page three to six sections at most, on other pages one or two, many pages none. Never every section: motion on every block distracts and slows reading. At most one striking effect (zoom, slide, wipe, blur, mask, parallax or anything bold) per screen height.
- **Never in the first screen.** No effect on the hero, the first section after it or the block that holds the largest image or heading of the first view (LCP), parallax included. On a short screen the second section is already in the first view.
- **Never** on the header, the navigation, forms, notices and messages (form errors, announcement bar, consent, alerts), legal texts or content a visitor needs right away (opening hours of today, prices next to a checkout, a warning).
- **Calls to action never wait.** No effect on a buttons block or a band whose purpose is the button; in a `stagger` the main button is never one of the later children. A closing band with a call to action stays still.
- **One effect per section,** on its root block or on its grid, not on both and not nested. Text sections: `rise` or `fade`. Cards, icon lists, columns, feature groups, bento and pricing grids: `stagger` on the block whose direct children are the cards or items (`core/columns`, `leitvia/icon-list`, the grid group), not on the outer band. Images and covers: `zoom`, `wipe-up`, `wipe-start`, `mask` or `blur`. Media and text side by side: `slide-start` on one half. Headings: `wipe-up` or `wipe-start` on the heading block, never split into words.
- **Calm sectors** such as a law firm, a medical practice, a public authority, an association, an insurer or a funeral home: `fade` or `rise`, `subtle` only, or no animation at all. When in doubt, none.
- **Tone of the brand:** lively brands (a restaurant, an agency, a shop for young buyers, software) may use `bold` for images and galleries; a site that reads quiet stays quiet and subtle.

## Accessibility

- Motion never carries information: the content, its order and its meaning are the same without the effect. Never write a text that refers to the motion ("see the points appear").
- Reduced motion, Motion off, no JavaScript and print show everything at once; that is the state to judge contrast, reading order and focus in, and the state an accessibility check sees.
- A reveal runs once and lasts at most 1.2 s, parallax follows the scroll and stops with it (WCAG 2.2.2 needs no pause button for either); nothing flashes (2.3.1). The accessibility bar has the switch "Motion off" (2.3.3), stored in the browser of the visitor.
- A hidden block shows itself when it gets focus, so keyboard users never land in invisible content (2.4.7, 2.4.11).
- The theme adds a mild hover of its own: a card with a link lifts 2px with the `raised` shadow, linked images scale to 1.03 inside their frame, in 200 ms, the same for keyboard focus, never with reduced motion or Motion off. It needs no attribute; never build hover effects into a pattern.

## Through the abilities

- **New pattern or variant:** set `leitviaAnimation` and `leitviaMotion` in the markup of `leitvia/create-pattern`, or of `leitvia/vary-pattern` with a full `content`. `edits` of a variant cannot set them.
- **New page:** `leitvia/compose-page` keeps the attributes the patterns carry; its edits (text, link, image) cannot add or remove them. Pick a pattern that already has the effect, or a variant with it.
- **Existing page:** `leitvia/update-block` with `attributes: { "leitviaAnimation": "rise", "leitviaMotion": "bold" }` works on every block that lists the attributes, core blocks and blocks with saved markup included, since only the block comment changes. `"leitviaAnimation": "none"` removes the effect, `"leitviaMotion": null` returns to the site default. Send only these two keys in that call; other attributes of a core block still go through their own rules. A block without the attributes (the excluded ones above) is refused with `leitvia_invalid_input`.
