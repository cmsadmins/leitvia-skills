name: leitvia-news
description: Writes a regular news post for the blog of a WordPress site with the Leitvia theme and Leitvia Studio, for example once a week, through the leitvia abilities only. Takes topics and sources from a news brief of the operator, checks candidates against the posts the site already has, writes the post from sources it lists under the post, makes it fit for search, Google News and AI answers (SEO and GEO: title, description, first paragraph, internal links, image, a site visible to search engines), marks it as written by AI and leaves it as a draft in a change package for a person. Use it for scheduled news runs or when someone asks for a news post from given sources; pages belong to leitvia-page.
compatibility: Needs a site with the theme Leitvia and the plugin Leitvia Studio, reached over the MCP server leitvia or the REST routes of the Abilities API with an application password. Steps 2 and 6 need leitvia/list-content and leitvia/create-content (Leitvia Studio after 1.0.0), step 5 leitvia/get-seo.

# leitvia-news

One run, at most one post: find what is new in the sources of the brief, drop what the site already covered, write a short post with its sources and an AI notice, make it fit for search and AI answers, and leave it as a draft in a change package. Nothing is published by this skill.

Read before the first call: the [agent handbook](../../handbook/README.md) (access, hashes, autonomy, packages, rejections, index of all abilities). Read the page of an ability before you first call it: [get-contract](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-get-contract.md), [list-content](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-list-content.md), [create-content](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-create-content.md), [get-seo](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-get-seo.md), [update-seo](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-update-seo.md), [list-packages](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-list-packages.md), [get-package](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-get-package.md). The brief, the duplicate check, the sources, the post format and the limits for SEO and GEO: [news details](references/brief.md). Overview, archives and post page come from the theme; setting up the blog itself: [blog or journal](../leitvia-page/references/blog.md).

## Access

MCP server `leitvia` or the REST routes of the Abilities API, as the agent user with its application password: [handbook, Access over MCP and REST](../../handbook/README.md#access-over-mcp-and-rest). Paths start at the address of the site, not at the host. Call `leitvia/get-contract` first and compare `site.url` with the address of your task; when they differ, write nothing and ask the person. Never use SQL, WP-CLI or the REST routes of WordPress core (`/wp-json/wp/v2/...`), not even to read. Reading public pages of the site and of the sources in the brief is fine. Where WP-Cron does not run by itself (WordPress Playground), call `GET /wp-cron.php` after each write.

## Modes

- **package** (the only mode of this skill): send one `package` key per run, for example `news-2026-43` (year and week), on every write. The post is created as a draft in that package; a person reviews, publishes or rejects it in the inbox of Leitvia Studio.

## Ground rules

- **Facts are never guessed.** Organization data, prices, legal texts, figures, quotes and people come only from a source you can name: the person, a page of the site or a read ability, with the source in your report. Without one, stop at a checkpoint; never write a placeholder that looks like a fact.
- In a news post the source of every fact is a source item of the brief, listed under the post. Quotes are short, marked and attributed; the rest is your own wording.
- At most one post per run, and never one that covers what the site already has (duplicate check).
- Every post is created with `ai_generated` true, so Studio shows readers a note that AI wrote it.
- Never publish, never change or delete existing posts, never schedule.
- A rejection is corrected at most once, following `message`, `next_ability` and `retry`. If the second call is rejected too, or `retry` is `never`, stop and tell the person.

## Steps

### 1. Read the brief

Read the news brief of the operator: topics, sources, language, cadence and the optional fields ([news brief](references/brief.md#news-brief)). Missing topics or sources: checkpoint **Brief**.

### 2. Read the site

- `leitvia/get-contract`: `site.url` and `site.language`.
- Existing posts and waiting drafts for the duplicate check, and the date of the latest post: [duplicate check](references/brief.md#duplicate-check).
- When the latest news post is younger than the cadence of the brief allows (a weekly brief and a news post from three days ago), write nothing and report it. A news post is a post in the category of the brief, or, without a category, a post with a list of sources; the sample post of WordPress and other posts do not count.

### 3. Collect candidates

Read the sources of the brief and note items newer than the latest post that fit a topic of the brief, each with URL, title, publisher and date ([sources](references/brief.md#sources)). Drop duplicates. Pick the one candidate that matters most to the audience of the brief; with none left, write nothing and report why.

### 4. Write the post

Write title, excerpt and content as block markup following the [post format](references/brief.md#post-format): the news first, short paragraphs, a list of sources with links. Check every fact against its source item once more before you write.

### 5. SEO and GEO

Required for every post; limits and Google News rules: [SEO and GEO](references/brief.md#seo-and-geo).

- `leitvia/get-seo` with the ID of the latest news post of step 2: `indexable` false means the site is hidden from search engines (checkpoint **Site hidden from search**); `plugin` says whether an SEO plugin is active.
- Title and excerpt within the limits: they are the SEO title and description of the draft, which has no ID until the package is applied. Without an SEO plugin say so in the report. With one, published news posts of earlier runs with an empty `seo.description` get title and description through `leitvia/update-seo` and the same `package` key, at most five per run.
- A first paragraph that answers who, what, when, where and why; h2 that name their section; two internal links, `link` from `leitvia/list-content`; a featured image of at least 1200 px width with alt text, or an open point in the report.

### 6. Create the draft

Call `leitvia/create-content` with `post_type` `post` (or the type of the content model the brief names, with its `fields`), `title`, `content`, `excerpt`, `slug`, `terms` (category and tags from the brief by name; new ones are created with the post, in a package when it is applied), `status` `draft`, `ai_generated` true, `sources` (the URLs), `featured_image` when step 5 found one, empty `base_hash` and the `package` key. A user who may not create the category (`leitvia_forbidden`, reason `capability`): send the call once more without it and name the category in the report.

### 7. Check and report

- `leitvia/list-packages` with `state: open` and `leitvia/get-package`: the package holds the draft and the SEO writes of step 5, nothing else.
- Open the preview link of the package from `leitvia/list-packages`: the post shows date and author, and its JSON-LD has `@type` `NewsArticle`, or `BlogPosting` when `news_categories` of Studio leaves out the category of the post. Anything else goes into the report.
- Report: a hidden site first, as high. Then package ID, Inbox link `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=leitvia-studio-agents&tab=inbox&package=<id>`, title, sources, the duplicates you dropped with the post they match, the SEO title and description, and open questions (image, SEO plugin, editorial page).

## Checkpoints

Stop and ask the person, then continue with the answer:

- **Brief:** topics or sources are missing, or a source asks for a login.
- **No news:** every candidate is a duplicate, or the cadence says it is too early. Report it; nothing to write.
- **Facts from the person:** a fact the post needs is in no source item.
- **Site hidden from search:** `indexable` is false ("Discourage search engines" in the reading settings). Only the person turns it off.
- **Second rejection** of the same call, or a rejection with `retry: never`.
- **Package applied:** a person reviews the draft, publishes or rejects it.

## Unattended

When no person answers (a scheduled or hosted run), do not wait at a checkpoint. Send the `package` key on every write, even when the briefing says nobody visits the site (mode `direct` needs a person who is present); never apply, roll back or publish anything. Take facts only from a source you name in the report (briefing, a page of the site, a read ability); without one the fact stays out and becomes an open question. A second rejection, or `retry: never`, stops that part. End with the package ID, what it holds and the open questions. Each checkpoint gets this answer:

| Checkpoint | Answer without a person |
|---|---|
| Brief | Stop; report what the brief lacks. |
| No news | Write nothing; report the candidates and why each was dropped. |
| Facts from the person | Leave the fact out; when the post makes no sense without it, write nothing. |
| Site hidden from search | Write the draft all the same; name it first in the report, as high, with the step of the person: Settings, Reading, untick "Discourage search engines". |
| Second rejection | Stop; report code and message. |
| Package applied | Expected: the draft waits in the package; the run ends with the report. |
