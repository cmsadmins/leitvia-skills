# SEO and GEO details

Load this file when the skill names it. It holds the rules behind steps 2 to 6 of [leitvia-seo-geo](../SKILL.md).

## Site visibility

Check this before any page. A site that tells search engines to stay away gains nothing from good titles.

| Check | Where | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Indexing | `indexable` of `leitvia/get-seo` (false when "Discourage search engines" is ticked in Settings, Reading) | false on a live site: high |
| Robots of the home page | `<meta name="robots">` of the public home page | `noindex`: high |
| robots.txt | `/robots.txt` | `Disallow: /` for all crawlers: high; no `Sitemap:` line: low |
| Sitemap | `/wp-sitemap.xml` or the sitemap of the SEO plugin | missing or empty: medium |
| News sitemap | `news_sitemap` of `leitvia/get-seo`, `/news.xml` | missing on a site with news: medium |

Only the person changes indexing, in Settings, Reading. Propose it plainly: "The site is live but asks search engines not to index it. Untick 'Discourage search engines' in Settings, Reading." A site that is not live yet may stay hidden; say so and move on.

## Titles and descriptions

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Title | At most 60 characters, the main topic first, unique on the site. Name what the page offers, not "Home" or "Welcome". An SEO plugin usually adds the site name; do not add it twice. Without one the title goes out as written. |
| Description | 50 to 160 characters, one or two full sentences that say what a visitor finds and why it helps. Unique per page. No list of keywords, no quotation marks around the whole text. |
| Language | The language of the page. A page in German gets a German title, whatever the language of the person. |
| Numbers | Only numbers the page holds: prices, years, counts. `leitvia/update-seo` rejects the others with `unsupported_fact`. |

Search engines may still show another text when theirs fits a search better; a good description makes that rarer, never impossible.

Fields `leitvia/get-seo` reads but `leitvia/update-seo` does not write: canonical, Open Graph title, description and image, focus keyword and schema type. Report problems with them for the person to fix in the SEO plugin. Without an SEO plugin Leitvia Studio prints the canonical of archives; Open Graph needs a plugin. A canonical that points to another page is often deliberate (a copy of a page); ask before you call it a mistake.

Common findings and what to do:

| Finding | Do |
|---|---|
| Two pages with the same title | Give each the topic that sets it apart. |
| Description empty | Write one from the first paragraph; the plugin would otherwise take any text of the page. |
| Description from `defaults` only (no plugin) | List it as a suggestion; WordPress prints no meta description by itself. |
| `noindex` on a page that should be found | Checkpoint Indexing; never change it on your own. |
| Legal page, search page or thank-you page indexed | Same checkpoint; many sites keep them out of search. |

## Structure for AI answers

AI search (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT search, Perplexity, Copilot) quotes short passages that make sense alone. What helps, all of it also good for people:

- The first paragraph answers the main question of the page in two or three sentences: who offers what, where, for whom.
- Headings name their section ("Prices for a bike service", not "More"). One `h1`, then `h2` and `h3` in order.
- Steps as numbered lists, comparisons as tables, facts with their unit and date.
- Articles show their date and author; keep both visible.
- Names stay the same everywhere: the organization, products and places as on the imprint.
- Questions people ask may become headings, answered right below, when the page really answers them. No invented FAQ.

Structured data: with an SEO plugin, the plugin prints it (its settings decide the types). Without one, Leitvia Studio prints, when its setting for structured data is on: `WebSite` with the organization on the front page, `BlogPosting` or `NewsArticle` with the organization as publisher and `BreadcrumbList` on posts, `CollectionPage` on the posts page and on archives, `ProfilePage` on author pages, and `FAQPage` from the FAQ block; `defaults.schema` of `leitvia/get-seo` names what a post gets. No `LocalBusiness`, no opening hours. Address, phone and email of the organization come from the Studio settings or `leitvia/set-organization` (only facts from the person or the imprint), `organization` of `leitvia/get-seo` shows them. With an SEO plugin Studio prints none of this. Never add JSON-LD in content blocks.

## Google News

Google decides which sites appear in Google News; the person applies in the Google Publisher Center. What the site can do:

- Structured data `NewsArticle` on news posts, from Leitvia Studio or the SEO plugin; `schema_type` of `leitvia/get-seo` shows it per post.
- The news sitemap `/news.xml` with the posts of the last 48 hours, listed in `robots.txt`.
- Transparency pages: imprint, contact, an editorial page (who writes, how sources are checked, how corrections work) and author pages with a biographical info. Missing ones go into the report for `leitvia-page` and the person.
- A featured image of at least 1200 px width on every news post, and `max-image-preview:large` in the robots meta, so large previews may show. Most SEO plugins print it; report it when the public post lacks it.
- Visible date and author, a title without clickbait that matches the h1, no new date on old posts.

## llms.txt

`llms.txt` is a proposed plain text file at the root of a site (`/llms.txt`) that tells language models what the site is and which pages matter. Not every AI service reads it; it costs little and harms nothing. Leitvia Studio does not write it; the person or the host puts the file on the server, or uses a plugin that serves it.

Draft from pages you read, in Markdown:

```
# Name of the organization

> One sentence: what the organization offers, where and for whom.

## Main pages

- [Services](https://example.org/services/): what is offered, with prices
- [About](https://example.org/about/): team and history

## Optional

- [News](https://example.org/news/): recent articles
```

Only published pages that should be found, each with a short note from its description. No pages with `noindex`, no private data.

## AI crawlers

`robots.txt` decides which crawlers may read the site, AI crawlers included (for example `GPTBot`, `OAI-SearchBot`, `PerplexityBot`, `Google-Extended`, `ClaudeBot`). Blocking them keeps the site out of the answers of those services; allowing them lets the services use the texts. That is a decision of the person about their content. Report what `robots.txt` says today and what each choice means; change nothing.
