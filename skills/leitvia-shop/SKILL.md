Reads products and categories, improves product texts, images with alt text, categories and tags, sets featured products, upsells, cross-sells and the sort order, and adds simple products, all in one change package for a person. Prices, tax and shipping change only with a value from the person and always wait for a person; orders, coupons and customers stay out of reach. Use it for product care in an existing shop; setting up a new shop belongs to leitvia-setup, shop pages to leitvia-page.

# leitvia-shop

Product care takes a shop that already sells and makes its catalog clearer: better texts, described images, tidy categories, products that lead to each other. You change the shop only through the abilities of Leitvia Studio; a person decides on prices and applies the package.

Read before the first call: the [agent handbook](../../handbook/README.md) (access, hashes, autonomy, packages, rejections, index of all abilities). Read the page of an ability before you first call it: [list-products](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-list-products.md), [get-product](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-get-product.md), [update-product](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-update-product.md), [update-product-category](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-update-product-category.md), [set-merchandising](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-set-merchandising.md), [create-product](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-create-product.md), [add-media](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-add-media.md), [set-alt-text](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-set-alt-text.md), [list-packages](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-list-packages.md), [get-package](../../handbook/abilities/leitvia-get-package.md).

## Access

MCP server `leitvia` or the REST routes of the Abilities API, as the agent user with its application password: [handbook, Access over MCP and REST](../../handbook/README.md#access-over-mcp-and-rest). Paths start at the address of the site, not at the host. Call `leitvia/get-contract` first and compare `site.url` with the address of your task; when they differ, write nothing and ask the person. Never use SQL, WP-CLI, the REST routes of WordPress core (`/wp-json/wp/v2/...`) or of WooCommerce (`/wp-json/wc/...`), not even to read. Reading public pages of the shop is fine. The product abilities exist only while WooCommerce is active; when `leitvia/list-products` is unknown, stop and tell the person.

## Modes

- **package** (default): send the same `package` key on every write of the task, for example `catalog-2026-10`. One task, one package for a person.
- **direct:** only when the person asks for it. The area `products` is `draft` by default: changes to drafts are written, changes to published products wait in a package of their own. Send no `package` key: a key always means a package.

## Ground rules

- Read before write. Take product IDs, term IDs and hashes from `leitvia/list-products` and `leitvia/get-product`, never from memory. A product sends the `hash` of `leitvia/get-product` as `base_hash`, a category or tag the `hash` of its term.
- **Facts are never guessed.** Organization data, prices, legal texts, figures, quotes and people come only from a source you can name: the person, a page of the site or a read ability, with the source in your report. Without one, stop at a checkpoint; never write a placeholder that looks like a fact.
- Product facts are facts too: material, size, weight, origin, care, certificates, delivery times and claims such as "handmade" or "organic" come from the product data (`attributes`, the current texts), a page of the site or the person. Better wording of a known fact is your work; a new fact is not.
- **Prices are never invented,** not even as a rounded or "psychological" price. `regular_price` and `sale_price` take a decimal number with a dot, from the person or a price list they named. A sale of "20 percent off" is computed from the current `price.regular` of `leitvia/get-product`; show the number at checkpoint **Facts from the person**. Changes to prices, tax and shipping land at most as a suggestion (content kinds `prices`, `tax`, `shipping`) until a person unlocked them; agents cannot unlock them.
- Orders, refunds, coupons, customers and sales figures are out of reach: every such object answers `leitvia_out_of_scope` with `retry: never`. Never infer best sellers; the person names them.
- Shop settings (payment, shipping zones, tax rates, currency, stock management) are the person's; no ability changes them.
- A rejection is corrected at most once, following `message`, `next_ability` and `retry`. If the second call is rejected too, or `retry` is `never`, stop and tell the person.
- Never write review notes or HTML comments into product texts. Open questions go into the report.

## Steps

### 1. Read the catalog

`leitvia/list-products` returns 20 products per page with `id`, `title`, `type`, `status`, `price`, `stock_status`, `featured` and `hash`, plus `categories` with their hash; page with `page` up to `pages`, or filter with `category` or `search`. Drafts are listed too. Then `leitvia/get-product` for each product you touch: texts, `images` with `alt`, `categories` and `tags` with their hash, `attributes`, `price` (read only), `upsells`, `cross_sells`, `variations` and `hash`.

A variable product lists the IDs of its variations; read each with `leitvia/get-product`. Of the product data a variation takes only image, prices, tax class and shipping class; gallery, categories, tags, tax status and merchandising belong to its parent, and a rejection names the fields it does not take.

### 2. Plan

List per product what you change and the source of each fact. Checkpoint **Plan confirmed** before the first write.

### 3. Texts and status

`leitvia/update-product` with `title`, `short_description` and `description`, all changes of one product in one call. Plain text becomes paragraph blocks (a blank line starts one); send block markup for lists or headings. Keep the short description to the point of the product (what it is, for whom, the one fact that decides); details go into the description. Change `status` only when the person asks; `publish` makes a draft visible to buyers.

### 4. Images

A product image needs alt text that says what the picture shows; product images are never decorative. An image of the library without alt text gets it first with `leitvia/set-alt-text` (`image`, `alt`), a new image comes with `leitvia/add-media` and `alt`. Then `image` and `gallery` (up to 20) on `leitvia/update-product`. An image added in the same package exists only after the person applied it: set it on the product in a second package. Product images square (1:1, 800 px or more).

### 5. Categories and tags

- Assign: `categories` and `tags` of `leitvia/update-product` take term IDs and replace the current lists; send the full list.
- Change a term: `leitvia/update-product-category` with `term` and the term `hash` changes `name`, `description` and, for categories, `parent` (0 for top level) and `image` (with alt text, 0 to remove). Tags have neither. The slug stays, so links keep working.
- A new category comes only with `leitvia/create-product`, as a name in `categories`; an empty category is a task for the person.

### 6. Merchandising

`leitvia/set-merchandising` sets `featured`, `upsells`, `cross_sells` (other products of the shop, up to 20) and `menu_order` of one product. The lists replace the current ones: start from `upsells` and `cross_sells` of `leitvia/get-product`. Upsells are a better or bigger version of the product, cross-sells what goes with it in the cart. Pick them from the catalog and say why; which products to feature comes from the person.

### 7. New products

`leitvia/create-product` creates a simple product with empty `base_hash`: texts, `sku`, `stock`, `categories` and an `image` with alt text. Prices, SKUs and stock come from the person, never a guess; a product with a price waits for a person. Variable products, attributes and stock changes of existing products are not in the abilities: the person makes them in WooCommerce.

### 8. The package

After the last write: `leitvia/list-packages` with `state: open`, then `leitvia/get-package` with `id`, and check each diff. Do not call `leitvia/apply-package`: the area `products` and the kinds `prices`, `tax` and `shipping` are not `autonomous` by default, and the person reviews the package at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=leitvia-studio-inbox&package=<id>`. Checkpoint **Package applied**. Afterwards read each product again with `leitvia/get-product` and request its `link`: it answers 200 and shows the new texts.

## Report

Write the report in the chat, in the language of the person:

1. **Package:** ID, state and the inbox link; which operations wait as suggestions (prices, tax, shipping).
2. **Changed:** per product what changed, with the source of each fact and price.
3. **Open with reason:** products without image alt text, facts without a source, stock or variable products for the person.
4. **Questions for the person:** prices, facts, products to feature.

## Checkpoints

Stop and ask the person, then continue with the answer:

- **Plan confirmed:** the products and changes of step 2, before the first write.
- **Facts from the person:** prices, product facts or claims without a source, and every computed sale price.
- **Package applied:** the person reviews and applies the package in the inbox before you check the shop or set images of a second package.
- **Second rejection** of the same call, or a rejection with `retry: never`.

## Unattended

When no person answers (a scheduled or hosted run), do not wait at a checkpoint. Send the `package` key on every write, even when the briefing says nobody visits the site (mode `direct` needs a person who is present); never apply, roll back or publish anything. Take facts only from a source you name in the report (briefing, a page of the site, a read ability); without one the fact stays out and becomes an open question. A second rejection, or `retry: never`, stops that part. End with the package ID, what it holds and the open questions. Each checkpoint gets this answer:

| Checkpoint | Answer without a person |
|---|---|
| Plan confirmed | Only the changes the briefing names; the plan goes into the report. |
| Facts from the person | Only prices and facts the briefing or a page of the site states, with that source in the report; a computed sale price or a fact without a source stays out and is listed as a question. |
| Package applied | Stop after step 8; the check of the shop and images of a second package belong to the next run. |
| Second rejection | Stop that product; report code and message. |
